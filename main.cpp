/* Class:- Robot
 * Defines an entity, Robot, which stores 16 genes, 4 sensors, and some
 * energy. It needs energy to remain alive and can move around the map
 * to search for batteries. 
 *
 * The 4 sensors are pointing in North, South, East and West directions
 * and detect what is present in the adjacent squares of the robot.
 * Sensor readings:
 * 0 - No object in square
 * 1 - Wall object
 * 2 - Battery object
 * 3 - Donâ€™t care if anything is there/Sensor gives corrupt reading
 *
 * Each gene is an array/vector containing five codes, 4 corresponding to each
 * sensors and the fifth denoting the robot's next action.
 * Robot Actions:
 * 0 - Move 1 north
 * 1 - Move 1 south
 * 2 - Move 1 east
 * 3 - Move 1 west
 * 4 - Move 1 random direction

/* Observations:
 * ============
 * 1. The initial random allocation of gene codes and their corresponding actions greatly affects the speed at which the
 *    average fitness score grows over generations.
 *    That is because if the gene pools are overall poorly made, but some robots performed well by chance, the subsequent
 *    generations will keep carrying those genes to a large extent as there is only 5% chance of mutation.
 * 2. In case of a good inital geen pool, the average fitness scores grow fairly quicky. But for some reason, this score
 *    kind of plateaus around 30-35 energy harvested. Sometimes this plateau is seen around 20 also.
 *    This may be related to the size of the map and the 40% distribution of batteries.
 * 3. On increasing the mutation rate, we observe a faster rate of growth in average fitness score, but the value fluctuates
 *    a lot more. It increses and decreases more dramatically between generations.
 * 4. On increasing the corruption rate of the sensor readings, the growth rate seems to consistently become slower.
 * 5. Finally, as we know that is infact a pseudo-random, whose seed we have passed as the time. But the randomness of this
 *    whole process for getting random numbers is very debatable. Thus, the randomness of this algorithm can also not be
 *    shown to a great extent.
